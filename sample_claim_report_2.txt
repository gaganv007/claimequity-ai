DENIAL REASON CODE: NMN-002
DENIAL REASON: Not Medically Necessary

Explanation:
This claim has been denied because the physical therapy services provided were 
determined to be not medically necessary based on the documentation submitted.

Our medical review team found that:
1. The treatment plan does not demonstrate functional improvement goals
2. Insufficient documentation of progress from previous sessions
3. The frequency and duration of services exceed what is typically considered 
   medically necessary for this diagnosis
4. No clear treatment plan or expected outcomes were documented

According to Medicare guidelines and your plan's medical policy, physical 
therapy services must be:
- Medically necessary for the treatment of a specific condition
- Provided under a written plan of care
- Expected to result in measurable functional improvement
- Provided by a qualified physical therapist

The documentation submitted does not meet these criteria.
