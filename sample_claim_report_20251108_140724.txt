### **Explanation of Denial**

Dear Mr. Smith,  

Blue Horizon Health Insurance has reviewed the claim submitted by Dr. Emily Carter, MD, and Springfield Diagnostics for services rendered on September 10, 2023. After careful consideration, we must deny payment for the above-listed services due to the absence of prior authorization.  

Under the terms of your Blue Horizon Health Plan (Policy #BH-GOLD-2023), prior authorization is required for certain diagnostic and outpatient services, including office visits for chronic condition management (CPT 99213), laboratory testing such as HbA1c (CPT 83036), and diagnostic procedures like electrocardiograms (CPT 93000). Our records indicate that no prior authorization request was submitted or approved for these services before the date of service.  

This determination was made in accordance with our medical policy guidelines (Policy MP-2023-045: Prior Authorization for Outpatient Services) and the provider contract agreement. As a result, the billed charges of $425.00 are not covered under your plan, and you may be responsible for the full amount. Please contact your provider to discuss payment arrangements if necessary.  

If you or your provider believe this determination is incorrect, or if prior authorization was obtained but not recorded in our system, you have the right to appeal this decision. Please refer to the appeal instructions below for further details.
